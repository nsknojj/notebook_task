# Jupyter Notebook Big Files Upload Plugin [[Github Link]](https://github.com/nsknojj/notebook/tree/big-upload)  
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing.  

Jupyter Notebook satisfies the demands of every user for processing data. However, while big data are accessible for a lot of users nowadays, Notebook doesn't support big file uploading with web interface. It only allows uploading files up to 25MB. Big Files Upload Plugin is designed to solve this problem and keep this upload function compatible with Notebook.
